-- This BigQuery function lets you perform a binomial distribution calculation.
-- In the example shown, the project is "dbo", but use whatever project name you would like
-- The factorials function must already exist
-- First parameter is number of trials, the second parameter is the exact number of successful trials you are seeking,
-- and the third parameter is the chance of success of an individual trial, expressed as a decimal (such as .5).

create or replace function dbo.binomial_dist (trials int, successes_desired int, probability float64)

           (dbo.factorial(trials)/
                                  (dbo.factorial(trials-successes_desired)*dbo.factorial(successes_desired)))*power(probability, successes_desired)*
